# REACT-VITE-POKEMONAPP
I used React, Vite, and Axios to build a simple app that consumes the PokeAPI (pokeapi.co). The app demonstrates my understanding of these technologies, showcasing the concepts I learned during my undergraduate classes. This project was part of a small class assignment designed to help us get acquainted with the frameworks and tools mentioned.
